# OIS-Decompile

## What is this?
This is an attempt (and successful so far) of decompiling the game Objects in Space. 
The assets folder won't be provided; you will need to get your own copy. (Either take it from a downloaded copy of the game from Steam or get it another way)

## How clean is the code?
It needs improvement. There are over 5k undefined functions, but that's about it. We don't have comments, and lots of code needs to be fixed.

## What version is this game from?
# I got this from STEAM, not gog so there may be a difference in assets folders, but I have not checked.
